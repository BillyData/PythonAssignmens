    "    In 1948, the World Health Organisation declared health a human right (Human Rights, n.d.), yet 4.5 billion people found themselves without access to essential medical services in 2023 (Tracking Universal Health Coverage, n.d.). Among the various factors that influence healthcare availability, social determinants of health - non-medical factors that determine well-being outcomes (Social Determinants of Health, n.d.) - are closely linked to the noticeable disparities in clinical access between different socioeconomic groups (McMaughan et al., 2020). Above all, discrimination (Rivenbark & Ichou, 2020), income differences (McMaughan et al., 2020), and educational levels (Zajacova & Lawrence, 2018) have significantly compromised equitable entry to medical treatments. This paper dissects how these social factors have undermined equity in the patient care sector and addresses the solution to mitigate the impacts of these challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tSkewed perceptions of the society's echelons favour the preferential classes and hinder those with lower socioeconomic positions. Discrimination in healthcare manifests in various forms, involving biased decision-making procedures and unequal treatment by medical professionals. This issue disproportionately affects marginalised and vulnerable populations whose access to clinical resources is limited (Adler & Stewart, 2010). In other words, physicians’ financial incentives prioritise those with higher socioeconomic status, thus resulting in less waiting time and a higher chance of receiving an appointment. A study by Angerer et al., 2019 reported that college graduates have higher chance of receiving an appointment and experiencing shorter waiting times, on average, two to three days less than those without a university degree. In addition, physicians' negative perceptions of this status group’s behaviour and personality also portray them as non-compliant and uncooperative (Arpey et al., 2017). Consequently, people from disadvantaged backgrounds would avoid wellness checkups due to their poor experience with prejudices from physicians. Furthermore, with this negative point of view on social groups with lower socioeconomic status, private medical care providers may not be keen on providing the highest-quality services to these patients, thus affecting the quality of care and patient satisfaction. To address these challenges, new policies must be implemented to forbid discrimination, provide patients a robust complaint mechanism, and raise awareness of the patients’ rights. \n",
    "\n",
    "\tIncome discrepancies magnify the gap in the use of primary care between various social classes with varying socioeconomic positions. With the struggle to afford the monthly bills and the lack of insurance benefits from low-income jobs, people from low-income working households and people of colour make up most of the 25.6 million non-elderly individuals without medical coverage in the U.S. (Tolbert et al., 2023). Similarly, without insurance, medication would be costly even for financially stable people, obstructing their ability to afford clinical expenses. In an extreme case, Wanyonyi, a man in Nairobi, Kenya, was detained in a hospital for his unpaid $39,570 infirmary bill (Hospitals around the World Detain Patients Who Cannot Pay Medical Bills - CBS News, 2018). The American comedian Groucho Marx once stated, “A hospital bed is a parked taxi with the meter running.”. The fear of incurring costly hospital expenses is a significant cause of forgone health checks, as out of ten Americans, four adults will have debts from treatment expenditures (Lopes et al., 2023). Further, frequent well-being assessments in low-income areas are inaccessible, mainly due to the lack of infirmary infrastructure (Guo et al., 2022). To address these issues, government regulation of the market-based healthcare sector must ensure fair prices of care services and products (WHO Publishes Pricing Policy Guideline to Improve Affordable Access to Medicines, n.d.). Likewise, there must be policies to promote the advancement of technology to drive down treatment costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "\tAnother major influencer of patient care’ accessibility is educational outcomes, which considerably influence literacy rates in healthcare. Educated individuals often possess a greater level of understanding of medical services and the importance of seeking help from clinical professionals (Levesque et al., 2013). Besides, they would be fully aware of their healthcare benefits and rights with a greater education level. Moreover, educated individuals would communicate more effectively with physicians, which helps address their wellness concerns more accurately and produce optimal recovery outcomes (Dewalt & Pignone, 2005). On the contrary, low educational backgrounds may lead to a poor understanding of medical terms and the benefits of preventive wellness measures, thus facilitating ignorance of self-assessment and inaccurate health beliefs. On top of that, individuals with higher education have healthier lifestyles and frequent clinic visits, resulting in better fitness status (Raghupathi & Raghupathi, 2020). Also, educated people may possess a more significant network of relationships, granting them high-quality insider information about the healthcare industry. Therefore, governments should promote a national program that takes a representative from each family whose educational level suffices to assess each family’s wellness and culture of self-care. Additionally, policies should be implemented to reduce the number of dropouts in school and promote education. Also, products detrimental to one’s well-being should be obligated to include consequence warnings so that those with lower educational abilities would be informed of these products’ critical damage. \n",
    "\n",
    "\tIn conclusion, there are undeniable correlations between social determinants of health and clinic care accessibility, which currently corrodes society’s justice at a concerning pace. Therefore, considerable efforts and resources are required from the community to overcome the disparities in medical accessibility and preserve the most basic human right. Policies must be implemented to prevent socioeconomic status from dictating the availability and quality of healthcare services. The mission of all societies should be to erase the disparities among different social classes in healthcare, as this is a moral imperative and the fundamental basis of an equitable and diverse society.\n",
